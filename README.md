# My take on Medium

The product that I love using is the online publishing platform Medium,developed by Evan Williams and launched in August 2012. It is owned by Medium Corporation. The platform is an example of social journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers on Medium. It also works as a blog host. Created by the former co-founder of Twitter,it encourage users to create posts longer than the then 140-character limit of Twitter. 

The platform software provides a full WYSIWYG user interface when editing online, with various options for formatting provided as the user edits over rich text format.

Once an entry is posted, it can be recommended and shared by other people, in a similar manner to Twitter. Posts can be upvoted in a similar manner to Reddit, and content can be assigned a specific theme, in the same way as Tumblr. Thus,blending quite a lot of different functionalities of different digital applications in one. 
 
The user experience is clean, minimal, and doesn’t have too much information for you to consume at once. Content is the main focus. 
Medium takes advantage of its black and white colour scheme. Because everything is so monochrome, the pops of colour are hard to ignore. Medium uses infinite scroll over pagination and displays quite an effective use of grids and lists.

Personally,I like the experience of writing on Medium. The minimal look of the page helps me to focus, and the autosave is both un-intrusive and helpful. Publishing and tagging is easy and simple, linking to my articles on other platforms is easy because of the rich embedding, and I like being able to share drafts privately with a simple link.

Posts on Medium are sorted by topic rather than by writer, unlike most blogging platforms.

Among its other competitors,I would say Medium stands out with it’s minimal interface,use of infinite scroll and the clean look and the use of eye catching fonts. It looks like a newspaper style blogging platform.
